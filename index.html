    <h3 class="heading">Economics + Creativity = ME!</h3>
    <p>
      I started college as in illustrator major, but during my second semester I decided to switch to Economics. Learning about what drives people to make decisions, whether financial or behavioral, fascinates me.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading">Fun Facts</h3>
    <p>
      I grew up in Colombia and moved to New York City when I was 12 years old. I enjoy reading motivational books with coffee and porter beers. Drawing, playing with my dogs and skating by the Hudson River every summer afternoon are among my favorite acitvities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connecting with people and sharing ideas are of paramount importance to me. From showing my drawings, sharing books and articles I have read, sharing other people's experiences, or trying to ruin everybody's hypothetical ending of Game of Thrones, I am always up for a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to work with people that are deeply  passionate about what they do; people that are willing to transcend the obvious choices in order to connect with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    I love visiting places that inspire me, as well as meet individuals that can motivate me. I love meeting people from different industries, learning what they do and how they approach their own challenges.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading">Things I've done</h3>
    <p>
      I've worked as a financial representative for a leading life insurance company, as a compliance analyst in an international banking firm and as a research assistant for a macroeconomic database. Currently, my interest lies on learning web development.
